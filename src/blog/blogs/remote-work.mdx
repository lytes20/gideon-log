# Remote Work
Remote work is a way to tap into talent that is not local to your location.

Remote work should not be seen as a convenience of work.

To maximize the quality and quantity of output, you need your core team at the same location. 

However sometimes that is not favorable because of borders, politics etc. That is when remote work comes into play.
