# Some Lessons (With some anime inspiration)
I draw lessons, inspiration from many things - people i interact with, just observing my surroundings, movies, shows, the few books I read, etc

Today I log about some lessons I have learned

### How Do You Train?


In athletic disciplines, training is clear and structured.
Take football for example - A footballer does not just *show up* to matches—they warm up, sprint, drill with the ball, stretch, practice technique, work on strength, and then rest and recover, etc There is a rhythm and intentionality to it.

But in many professions, especially software engineering, **training may not be as obvious**.
Like - What does "practice" look like for us? What does a training session look like? 
Is it studying?

Learning from athletics, training is as important as performing. You can only fight how you train.
Training is how you stay sharp. Training is how you grow. Training is how you build the mental muscles to solve harder problems with more clarity.


### I Am Your Opponent

Life is a series of battles:
Your health, your career progression, your relationships, your finances, your skill growth, etc.

Each goal has its own opponent—a set of tasks, challenges, hurdles you must overcome.

But facts:

**Your time, energy, and bandwidth are limited.**
You cannot win every battle simultaneously.
I have experienced this first hand. It is easy to lose track of which battle actually matters *right now*.
Sometimes you fight everything and win nothing.

You need to know when to narrow your focus.  Align strategy. Concentrate energy.

Identify the battle you are fighting right now. Face the correct opponent.
Everything else is noise.


### Iteration

Every discipline — sports, art, engineering, business etc, grows through one thing:

**Iteration.**

Iteration is how you unlock growth.
It is the compounding effect of repeated attempts, each one slightly better than the last.

Consistency beats intensity.
Small improvements

### Skill Focus

Every field demands multiple skills.
Software engineering alone touches frontend, backend, databases, systems, algorithms, architecture, security, etc.

And within each of these are dozens of sub-skills and technologies.

Facts:

**You do not need to master everything, especially not at once.**

Pick one skill. Commit to it. Go deep.

Take frontend for example - If you choose React, become a damn good React developer. Over time you will find yourself naturally branching out into complementary skills. 
From React developer to probably a damn good full stack developer, or damn good web designer with killer react and figma skills.

Take data structures - You do not need to learn all the data structures. It is okay to just know arrays alone for example. If it is only arrays you use for the next 3 years so be it.
Arrays alone can build countless applications.
And once you deeply understand one data structure, the next one becomes more intuitive. Arrays lead to linked lists. Linked lists lead to trees. Trees lead to graphs etc

Pick a skill. Focus on it. Become unreasonably good at it. Everything else will follow naturally

###  Learn by Doing 
Build a thousand kitchen knives.

Just today(Time of writing this), I was listening to a youtube video(Yes listening, it was playing in the background) and someone said "The world does not need another TODO app". 

I disagree.

Maybe it does not. But most of us became software engineers because of TODO apps, CRUD apps, and tiny experiments.

In an era of AI, building simple apps might feel boring or unnecessary.
But facts are:

You learn by doing.

You grow by building.


Suh, ya hear me:

Gwan build a thousand TODO apps.

Giddem a thousand CRUD apps.

Build all those small experiments in your head.

Because:
Repetition builds familiarity.
Repetition builds intuition.
Repetition prepares you to walk into large, complex codebases with confidence.
