# Create a React App from Scratch 🚀

Earlier this year, React officially [sunset Create React App (CRA)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app), a tool that many of us relied on to quickly set up React applications. It was an easy-to-use tool that abstracted a lot of complexities, making it simple to get started with React.

Today, if you check the [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app), they strongly recommend using a framework like Next.js or Remix. But what if you don't want to use a framework? Maybe you just want to build a simple React website or have full control over your web app from the start. That's exactly what this guide is for! 🎯

### What is React? 🤔
If you're new to React, here's a quick introduction. React is the most popular JavaScript library for building web applications. It is:

Easy to learn
- Component-based (so you can reuse code efficiently)
- Great for managing state and complex UI interactions
- Supported by a huge developer community

I have been building React applications for over six years, and I love how easy it is to build reusable web components, manage state, and integrate with other libraries. Now, let's get into the fun part—building a React app from scratch! 🎉

#### Step 1: Install Node.js 🛠️
To get started, you need Node.js installed on your computer. If you haven't installed it yet, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

Once installed, open your terminal and verify the installation by running:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v 
```

This should display the versions of Node.js and npm.

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Project 📂
Navigate to the folder where you want to create your React app and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir mauzo
```

```bash
cd mauzo 
```

You can call your application any name you want - I just called mine mauzo 📊 (meaning sales) because we are going to build the next big application to track your sales activities 😎

Now, initialize an npm project:

```bash
npm init -y 
```

This will generate a package.json file with default settings.

#### Step 3: Install React 📦
Next, install React and ReactDOM: 

```bash
npm install react react-dom 
```

- `react` - allows you to write jsx. provides the core library for creating and managing UI components. 
- `react-dom` enables rendering react components in the DOM browser.

Your folder structure should now look like this:

```
/mauzo
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── package.json
  ├── package-lock.json 
```

#### Step 4: Create the Entry Files 📝
1. **Create index.html**
Create an index.html file and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Mauzo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="index.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html> 
```

2. ***Create index.jsx**
Now, create an index.jsx file and add this code:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello world 🌍</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Mauzo 🎉</h2>
  </div>
); 
```

#### Step 5: Set Up a Dev Server ⚡
At this point, we have a React app, but we need a development server to run it. Since browsers don't understand JSX, we need a bundler to handle it. There a few tools we can use for this such vite, webpack, parcel etc. We'll use Vite because I have come to love this tool 😍. It's fast, has great documentation, and is easy to use. 🚀

***Install Vite:***
```bash
npm install -D vite 
```
***Install the Vite plugin for React:***

```bash
npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-react 
```

***Configure Vite:***
Create a vite.config.js file and add this code:

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
}); 
```
Your project should have the following structure now:

```text
/mauzo
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── index.html
  ├── index.jsx
  ├── package.json
  ├── package-lock.json
  ├── vite.config.js
```
#### Step 6: Add Scripts 🏗️
Update your package.json to include these scripts:

```text
......
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build"
...... 
```
#### Step 7: Run Your App 🎯
Now, start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev 
```
You should see a development server running. Open the provided URL in your browser, and you should see:

***Hello, world! 🌍 and Welcome to Mauzo 🎉***



Congratulations! You have successfully created a React app from scratch! 🚀
