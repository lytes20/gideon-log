# Some lessons from anime
## How do you train?
In athletic disciplines it is easy to define training. 
Forexample, a footballer, a daily training might look like:
- Warm up, sprint 2 hours total, stretch, do some drills with the ball, do some polymetrics, do some strength training etc
- Rest and recover, etc

How about you in your profession or line of work how do you train for performance. Training is very important, training is how you stay sharp. Training is how you grow in whatever discipline you are in

So my question to you is have you identified how to train in your line of work?

## I am your opponent
At any one point in life you are fighting so many battles. You are trying to get a promotion at work. You are trying to get fit, hit your fitness goals, you are trying to find love etc
All these things you are trying to achieve can be viewed as battles you are fighting. And your opponent is whatever set of tasks you need to get done, whatever set of hurdles you need to over come.

The thing is because a one's time, capacity, Bandwidth  is limited you can not win all your battles at the same time. And the problem i have also noticed is it easy to loose sight of what battle is important at any one given time.
